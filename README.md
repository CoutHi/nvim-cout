This is a simple Neovim configuration that has the Lazy plugin manager, Treesitter, a theme that supports syntax highlighting (kanagawa-nvim), Telescope for browsing files and Mason to get LSPs up and running quickly.

I also added some of my custom keybindings and some editor options.

It's quite minimal and simple to understand, could be a good place to start off of.

Thank you Vhyrro for teaching me about Neovim and helping me put this together!
